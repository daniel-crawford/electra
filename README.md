# Project Outline: ELECTRA
**Electrification Leveling and Efficiency Cost-Targeting ROI Analyst**

## 1. Project Overview
Develop an end-to-end platform that recommends optimal electrification upgrades for small-industrial facilities, predicts their ROI, and provides interactive financial simulations. The system will leverage machine learning to analyze energy usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and suggest cost-effective clean energy solutions.

## 2. Key Components
### a. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- **Input:** Energy usage data (electricity bills, IoT sensor data, historical usage patterns, operational schedules).
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing or incomplete data, standardize units, and normalize for comparison.
- **External Sources:** Incorporate external datasets for enriched insights:
    - Weather data to account for climate impact on energy usage (e.g., NOAA, OpenWeather).
    - Market prices of electrification technologies (e.g., solar panels, batteries).
    - Regulatory information for compliance with energy standards.

### b. Machine Learning Models
- **Clustering Model:**
    - **Identify patterns in energy consumption to group users with similar profiles.**
    - **Algorithm:** DBSCAN.
    - **Output:** Classify users into clusters (e.g., high inefficiency, high variability).

- **Recommendation System:**
    - **Use classification or regression models to suggest electrification upgrades.**
    - **Algorithm:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
    - **Input:** User energy data, environmental factors, and historical ROI data.
    - **Output:** Recommendations (e.g., solar installation, HVAC upgrades).

- **ROI Estimation Model:**
    - **Predict financial outcomes based on recommended upgrades.**
    - **Algorithm:** Linear Regression, Bayesian Models, or DNN for time-series forecasting.
    - **Input:** Investment costs, energy savings, and incentive policies.
    - **Output:** ROI predictions (e.g., payback period, cost savings).

### c. Interactive User Interface
- **Frontend:**
    - Build with React for a modern, responsive UI.
    - Visualize energy inefficiencies (charts, heatmaps).
    - Determine Energy Usage Profiles

### d. Financial Simulations
- Enable users to:
    - Compare different electrification options.
    - Simulate investment scenarios (e.g., varying upfront costs, financing plans).
    - Visualize long-term savings and ROI projections.

## 4. Deliverables
- A fully functional prototype hosted on a cloud platform.
- Interactive visualizations of energy usage patterns and inefficiencies.
- Machine learning-driven upgrade recommendations with ROI predictions.
- Engineering design documentation detailing the architecture and decision-making process.
